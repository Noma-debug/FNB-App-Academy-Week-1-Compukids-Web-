This repository contains my Week 1 ptoject from the FNB App Academy. The focus for this week was on foundational web development skills using HTML5 — the core language for building and structuring websites and web apps.
Topics Covered:
1. Introduction to HTML
   HTML5 provides support for the latest multimedia
   It is easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.).
   Many features of HTML5 have been built to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.
  HTML5 is a good language to develop cross-platform mobile applications (applications that work on various devices running various operating systems, such as iOS and Android).
